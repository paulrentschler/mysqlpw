# MySQLpw - the missing password manager for MySQL

MySQLpw provides a secure way to create users and change passwords from the command line for a MySQL database.

All of the built-in MySQL ways of doing this will cause the new password to be logged in **plain-text** in either your .bashrc or .mysql_history file.
